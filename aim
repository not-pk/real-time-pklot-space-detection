This code provides a basic structure for a real-time parking space detection system. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

Data Collection: You'll need to collect video data of parking lots and manually label parking spaces.
Preprocessing: This step involves resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and applying any necessary filters.
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the images that will help identify parking spaces.
Model Training: Use a machine learning algorithm (in this case, Support Vector Machine) to train on the extracted features.
Real-time Detection: Apply the trained model to new video frames to detect parking spaces in real-time.

To implement this project in Jupyter Labs, you'll need to:

Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-learn)
Collect and prepare your dataset
Implement each function in separate cells
Run the main execution cell to test your system
